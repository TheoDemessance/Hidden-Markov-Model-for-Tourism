In this folder, I present you my GI package. You can find my proper implmentation of the trie, and the 2 versions of Alergia I've coded.

To run it, as an input in main, you need to put a list of sequences, and the alpha in up to you (between >0 and 1).
As an input, you will have a trie object representing your Deterministic Probabilistic Finite Automaton.
