    "To transform a prefix tree into a frequency automaton (and thus a probabilistic one), a state-merging algorithm is used. Currently, the best one has been created by Colin de la Higuera. It is implemented from scratch below:\n",

    "First of all, we have in parameters the sequences and an alpha parameter [0, 1]. \n",

    "The purpose of the algorithm is to keep only the red states. At the beginning,RED contains only the root node, whileBlue contains the immediate successor nodes of the initial node: the child nodes of the root. When executing the external loop of the algorithm, the first qb node in BLUE is chosen. If there is a qr node in RED compatible with qb, then qb and its successor nodes are merged with qr and the corresponding successor nodes of qr, respectively, as described in the Merge&Fold section. If qb is not compatible with any of the states of RED, it will be promoted, i.e. it will switch to RED, and its respective children will switch to BLUE.\n",

    "#### Merge&Fold operation:\n",
    "Given the DFA, the merge operation takes 2 states q and q′, where q is a RED state and q′ is a BLUE state compatible with the Hoeffding test. The Merge operation consists of 2 steps. First, if q′est is a final state, then q becomes one as well (if it was not already the case) and the number of sequences ending in q′ is added to the number of sequences ending in q. Second, incoming arcs to q′sont redirected to q. If such arcs already exist, the number of passing sequences in each incoming arc is added to the existing arc. The Fold operation is a recursive function of merging the successor nodes q′ into q and the corresponding successor nodes of q respectively."
