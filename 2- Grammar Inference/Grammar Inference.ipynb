    "The purpose of the algorithm is to keep only the red states. At the beginning,RED contains only the root node, whileBlue contains the immediate successor nodes of the initial node: the child nodes of the root. When executing the external loop of the algorithm, the first qb node in BLUE is chosen. If there is a qr node in RED compatible with qb, then qb and its successor nodes are merged with qr and the corresponding successor nodes of qr, respectively, as described in the Merge&Fold section. If qb is not compatible with any of the states of RED, it will be promoted, i.e. it will switch to RED, and its respective children will switch to BLUE.\n",

    "Given the DFA, the merge operation takes 2 states q and qâ², where q is a RED state and qâ² is a BLUE state compatible with the Hoeffding test. The Merge operation consists of 2 steps. First, if qâ²est is a final state, then q becomes one as well (if it was not already the case) and the number of sequences ending in qâ² is added to the number of sequences ending in q. Second, incoming arcs to qâ²sont redirected to q. If such arcs already exist, the number of passing sequences in each incoming arc is added to the existing arc. The Fold operation is a recursive function of merging the successor nodes qâ² into q and the corresponding successor nodes of q respectively."
