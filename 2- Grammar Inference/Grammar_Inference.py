def MergeFold(trie, qr, qb):

    MERGE OPERATION: 
    To merge a BLUE node into a RED node, all the ingoing links of BLUE node are redirected to the RED node. 
    If the RED node already has an ingoing link with the same item attribute as a redirected link, then only the frequencies are added. 
    Next, the BLUE node attribute is added to the RED node attribute.
    
    FOLD OPERATION:
    When a BLUE node merges into a RED node, all children of BLUE node are recursively merged into children of the RED node with the same item attribute link.
    If the link with an item attribute doesn't exist in the RED node, a new child is inserted.

    trie -- the current Trie we are working on
    qr -- the red node 
    qb -- the blue node to merge
