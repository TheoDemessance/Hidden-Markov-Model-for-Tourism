Our database is composed of users, reviews, and geo-located locations. A location is composed of coordinates $(lat, long)$ and a rating. To characterize the location, each of them has been aligned with administrative areas [GADM](https://gadm.org/index.html). 386,735 administrative areas (country, region, department, district, city, and town).

A user is identified by nationality, age and is described by a timeline. A user timeline represents a chronological set of reviews from its first reviews to its last reviews. This timeline allows computing intermediate properties: the time between two consecutive reviews, consecutive visited places. 

A review represents a note given by a user on a location at a given discrete-time domain. 

Different analysis and key points are clarified in the notebook.
