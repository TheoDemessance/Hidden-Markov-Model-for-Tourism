# Hidden Markov Model for Tourist Recommendation
This repository presents the results and discussion of my scientific paper : "Hidden Markov Model for Tourist Recommendation"

Social networks are a popular means of analysing tourist behaviour thanks to the digital traces left by travellers during their trips on these networks. The large amount of data generated by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos makes it possible to model their journeys and analyse their behaviour. 
Predicting tourist movements plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support tools such as applications that recommend places for a tourist to visit. 

This paper addresses the problem of modeling and predicting the future be-havior of a tourist-based on his present and past behavior in a given area. Based on the geo-localized and temporal data information, we propose in this paper a model for predicting future tourist behavior by analyzing the time sequences of places visited by a set of tourists. 

Our approach is to learn behaviors from a set of temporal sequences of places, through various methods to handle the difficulties due to big data. The proposed method uses a machine learning method developing a hidden Markov model representing the whole data set. The model can produce predictions as a recommendation of future places to visit. The model can also be updated to adapt to new behaviors. 

Our model is built from the whole data without reducing its size and with-out extracting a mathematical model. Thereby, we propose a new algorithm for automatic learning of grammatical inference to reduce its complexity in the context of big data. Moreover, this algorithm is designed to maintain all behavioral possibilities on the data set. We can retrieve the principal contributions of our works in the different folders of this project:

1.  A method to establish sequences representing a unique stay of a tourist fromTripadvisor ranking data; 
2.  A new method of grammatical inference for processing very large data set;
3.  A flexible and relevant decision-making tool to represent all touristsâ€™ behaviors in a dataset. This decision-making tool is able to predict future behavior and recommend places to visit for a tourist.
