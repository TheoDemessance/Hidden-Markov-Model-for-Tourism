# Hidden Markov Model for Tourist Recommendation
This repository presents the results and discussion of my scientific paper : "Hidden Markov Model for Tourist Recommendation"

Social networks are a popular means of analysing tourist behaviour thanks to the digital traces left by travellers during their trips on these networks. The large amount of data generated by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos makes it possible to model their journeys and analyse their behaviour. 
Predicting tourist movements plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support tools such as applications that recommend places for a tourist to visit. 

In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' behaviors based on social network data. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. 

The proposed method produces a hidden Markov model representing the behaviors of a group of tourists. The hidden Markov model is flexible and editable with new data. 

A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data. 

The capital city of France, Paris is selected to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology.

In folder [1](https://github.com/TheoDemessance/Hidden-Markov-Model-for-Tourism/tree/main/1-%20Data%20Analysis) we present the data analysis methods and results. Folder [2](https://github.com/TheoDemessance/Hidden-Markov-Model-for-Tourism/tree/main/2-%20Grammar%20Inference) provides the grammar inference algorithm developed and results.
The [3](https://github.com/TheoDemessance/Hidden-Markov-Model-for-Tourism/tree/main/3-%20Hidden%20Markov%20Model)rd file focuses on the hidden Markov model method. Finally, the model is implemented and is the subject of a case study introduced in binder [4](https://github.com/TheoDemessance/Hidden-Markov-Model-for-Tourism/tree/main/4-%20Discussion%20and%20results).
