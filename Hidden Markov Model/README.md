# Hidden Markov model implementation and results

A frequency automaton can not be exploited with its structure, because in the literature there are not existing algorithms or methods that allow to update a frequency automaton.
Thus, the frequency automaton is transformed into a stochastic automaton and then to a Hidden Markov Models (HMM).

Algorithms and results are described in the folder.
